# You're building something meaningful and it's getting complex.
You're doing the work, but you can feel the friction.
That friction has a cost.
It shows up as stalled initiatives, priority proliferation, slow decisions, and a low-grade sense of "why is this so hard?"
But the impact is more serious, missed revenue targets, customer churn, employee retention challenges
Your business is full of smart, capable people but somehow still stuck. Not because anyone's lazy or incompetent but because something structural is off and no one can quite name it
I specialise in finding that drag fast and removing it without theatre, jargon, or blame.
