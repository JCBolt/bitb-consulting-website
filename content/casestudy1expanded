### Case Study: A $2M Team Trapped in Invisible Drag

**Why I was brought in**

I was asked to “build some product processes.”

**What I actually found**

A ~$2M delivery team that was busy and committed, but was losing an estimated **30–40% of its capacity** to structural drag.

Not because people weren’t trying but because the system made consistency impossible.

Priorities shifted frequently. Leadership could—and did—change direction mid-stream. Client-driven deadlines forced engineering to take shortcuts just to keep up.

Those shortcuts didn’t disappear but surfaced later as production outages, rework, and growing delivery risk.

**The constraint I named**

There were no stable, shared priorities nor clear dependency mapping before starting an initiative.

Without a clear planning horizon or explicit trade-offs, teams were constantly context-switching. Short-term delivery pressure crowded out the time required to build things properly, quietly compounding technical and operational debt.

**What I changed**

I designed and implemented:

- A quarterly planning cadence to stabilise priorities
- Explicit trade-offs so changes were conscious, not reactive
- Dependency mapping to surface potential delays in delivery
- Accountability and communication structures that reduced last-minute churn

**The result**

As priorities stabilised, shortcuts decreased and customer value delivery regained predictability. We built visible capacity and business ROI for initiatives to stabilise and improve the system.

Engineering spent less time firefighting and more time doing the work properly.

The team didn’t work harder, but the system stopped forcing failure.
