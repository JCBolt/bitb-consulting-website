# Case Studies

**Designed and delivered a multi-continent, business-critical platform migration bringing a key technology asset and millions of records of data in-house.** Led 80+ people in Canada and England across 12 concurrent workstreams. Coordinated stakeholder alignment across the business and oversaw technical and business delivery. Went live with 10 minutes of planned downtime, zero outages, zero data integrity issues. Direct business impact: multiples increase in company valuation.

**Brought in to 'build some product processes'—diagnosed a $2M team losing 30–40% of their capacity to invisible drag.** Designed quarterly planning, tight accountability systems, dependency mapping, proactive communication systems. Result: predictable delivery, strategic work shipping, leadership out of firefighting mode.

**Siloed engineering team, broken collaboration with Product and Design, chronic timeline misses and months of overruns.** Rebuilt cross-functional relationships, embedded product and design into delivery, ran org-wide training with go-to-market teams. Impact: engineering satisfaction increased significantly, culture shifted from 'us vs them' to collaborative delivery, eliminated the 'broken windows' problem—teams now finish what they start.

**Company expanding into enterprise healthcare—new flagship client signed, but internal confusion on whether their systems could actually deliver the required functionality.** Defined what success looked like (every team had a different version), assessed 3 core systems for readiness, identified critical gaps and prioritized risks. Delivered a clear roadmap for launch plus surfaced process, training, and data gaps outside the original scope.

**Service business brought me in to validate a critical tech decision.** Cut through the noise, designed a right-sized integration solution, ran vendor selection and POC. Bonus: identified over $100K/year in manual workarounds, technical debt the execs didn't know about, and showed them how to fix their external dev engagement to stop building the wrong things.
