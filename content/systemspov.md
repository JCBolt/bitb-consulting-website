Every broken system is protecting something, whether it's power, speed, safety, or status.
If you don't identify what it's protecting you can't fix it.
This is why internal teams so often can't solve the problems they're living inside. The system works well enough for someone with authority, even as it quietly taxes everyone else.
My job is to surface that truth early, name it without blame, and design changes that actually stick because they account for how the organisation really operates, not how it wishes it did.
I combine systems thinking with emotional intelligence. I see the friction, name it cleanly, and design changes that account for how people actually work not just how org charts say they should.
I'm not here to make you comfortable, I'm here to expose the constraint and fix it.
