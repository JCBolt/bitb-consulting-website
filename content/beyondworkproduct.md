I wrote and published a book about burnout, good-girl conditioning, and how I rebuilt my relationship with work and ambition. It has a 4.8★ average rating on Amazon, and writing it fundamentally changed how I lead and how I design environments where people can do meaningful work with joy and without burning out.
I'm a board member of a youth-focused, nature-based organisation, and I'm a mentor through the Opening Doors Foundation.
In 2024–2025, my family and I lived for a year in an eco-village in Bali while our kids attended Green School. It was an expansive, uncomfortable, rewarding experience and it continues to shape how I think about systems, sustainability, and what "enough" actually looks like.
Back in Vancouver now, I love:
 - Spending time in the forest or skiing in the mountains
 - Facilitating the lives of my two kids (12 and 9)
 - Using our back garden sauna
 - Reading fiction, dancing hip hop, or learning to play the drums
