### Case Study: A Business-Critical Platform Migration with Zero Room for Error

**Why I was brought in**

A core technology platform needed to be migrated in-house. It was business-critical and involved **millions of records of data**.

The data lived in a legacy proprietary system and needed to be migrated into a **different custom-built platform** that did *not* yet support all required functionality.

**What made this genuinely hard**

This was not a lift-and-shift migration.

The incoming data exposed real gaps in the target platform. A complex ETL was required, alongside **new product and engineering work** to ensure the data could be correctly supported, used, and maintained once live.

At the same time:

- **80+ people** across Canada and England were involved
- Work was split across **12 concurrent workstreams**
- Business, product, and engineering risks were tightly coupled

Incorrect sequencing in any one area would cascade across the programme

**The constraint I focused on**

This programme would fail if **technical discovery, product decisions, and delivery coordination** drifted out of sync.

The work required someone who could:

- Get into the technical weeds when needed
- Translate implications clearly to non-technical stakeholders
- Maintain system-level coherence across all workstreams

That was the role I played.

**What I did**

I owned the programme end-to-end, going deep only where the risk demanded it.

- Led overall programme design, delivery and sequencing across all workstreams
- Oversaw the ETL strategy and migration approach
- Identified functional gaps in the target platform and shaped the required development work
- Ensured tight alignment between business expectations, product decisions, and engineering delivery
- Maintained clear ownership, decision pathways, and escalation mechanisms throughout

**What changed**

The platform went live with **10 minutes of planned downtime**, **zero outages**, and **no data integrity issues**.

A critical technology asset was successfully brought in-house, with the required functionality in place to support the migrated data. Long-term dependency risk was reduced, and a core driver of company value was strengthened.

The result: **a direct increase in company valuation**.
