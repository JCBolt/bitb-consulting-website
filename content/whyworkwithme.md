I see and say what most teams step around.
I read rooms exceptionally well which means I notice the things others politely ignore. Not just what's being said, but what can't be said without risk.
I'm wired to keep asking questions past when it gets uncomfortable, until I understand. This surfaces the constraint the system is quietly protecting.
When that happens:
False alignment becomes visible
Real trade-offs appear
Work-in-progress drops because decisions finally have teeth
Teams usually realize they haven't had a delivery problem—they've had a clarity problem.
With clarity, the system stops asking people to do contradictory things. Leadership time stops burning and starts creating momentum.
