# How We Work Together

## Diagnostic engagement (2–4 weeks)
I come in, identify the constraint, map the cost, and give you a clear path forward.
## Strategic project delivery (3–6 months)
You need something complex designed and delivered—platform migrations, cross-functional realignment, delivery system rebuilds.
## Fractional leadership (ongoing)
You need someone who can see across the whole system and operate in the space between teams, surfacing the organisational drag and fixing it before it costs you six figures in lost momentum. I step in as fractional Chief of Staff: I connect what leadership wants with what's actually possible, translate between silos, and ensure strategic work wins over operational chaos. This isn't calendar management! It's strategic systems thinking that makes momentum inevitable.
Or you have a gap in tech, product, or delivery leadership. Either way, I step in as a strategic partner until you're stable or hired.
Most engagements begin with a short diagnostic conversation to confirm fit, scope, and investment.
